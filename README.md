# StringStaticLib3_4

Task:
Write programs in C++ that demonstrate the use of the single class inheritance mechanism according to the option:
● Describe the class in the project in the library code
Do not use input/output operators!
● For data members, limit the possibility of direct modification using access modifiers.
At the same time, provide for the possibility of reading this data
● The class must have all types of constructors. Demonstrate an explicit call to the base class constructor from the derived class constructor. In C++, divide the class into .h and .cpp files. Describe the use of the class in a project that is a console application. In a console application, input/output operators can be used to interact with the user.
